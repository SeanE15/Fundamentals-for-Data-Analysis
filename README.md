# Introduction:

### Hello, and welcome to my github repository. This repo has been created in order to satify the work required to complete the Fundamentals for Data Analysis course - which is a key part to my completion of the HDip in Computer Science with Data Analytics at the Atlantic Technological University. This repository contains two main bodies of work - the weekly jupyter notebooks which I have compiled throughout the course and a project which focuses ont he analysis of 'The Normal Distribution'.

# System Requirements:

### To modify or run the notebooks on a local machine requires the latest version of Python. Anaconda is an easy to use version available at the following URL's for Windows, Mac and Linux. Alternatively the static and interactive web based versions of the notebooks are available via the links below.

# Jupyter Notebooks

## To run the notebooks on a local machine following the installation of python you should do the following:

### [1] Open the command line on your machine. I recommend CMDer if using Windows, but the native terminal works fine on Linux/Mac.

### [2] Navigate to the appropriate folder that contains the notebook that is linked with your github account.

### [3] type "Jupyter notebook" and press "Enter"

### [4] Your browser should automatically start and open up in the jupyter notebook program, if it doesn't a URL link should displace on the cmder screen.
