    "# What is the Normal Distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'Normal distribution', also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric and centred on the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data further from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "In graphical form, the normal distribution appears as a \"bell curve\". The Normal Distribution is a proper name for a 'probability bell curve'. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few key pieces of information that we need ot take note of before we delve into 'The Normal Distribution'; namely that the mean of the distribution is zero and it's standard deviation is 1. It has zero skew and a kurtosis of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "'Skew' is the measurement of symmetry in the distribution or (more precisely) the lack of symmetry of a distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "'Kurtosis' is a measurement of whether a data set is heavy-tailed or lightly-tailed. If a data set has outliers or is heavy tailed it has high kurtosis; with the low kurtosis meaning light tails and lack of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A histogram is an effective graphical representation for showing both skewness and kurtosis of a data set.\n"
