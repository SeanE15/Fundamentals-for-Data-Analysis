    "If we are judging the answer for this question from the previous constraints it is correct that there are the same number of ways to get 4 heads as 4 tails. In this instance we are flipping a coin to determine the outcome of the above - there is a 50/50 chance that any coin flip will either land on heads or tails - with the previous outcome baring no consequence on the forthcoming result. This is because in a coin toss there can only be 2  possible outcomes (unless the coin lands on its edge, which has not been accounted for). The number for heads/tails is interchangeable; as the only outcomes can either be 1's or 0's (one side of the coin or the other). As such; the head/tails 'label' is purely defined by the coin flipper - and there are a finite amount of combinations for the flips. (210 possible combinations to be precise).\n",
