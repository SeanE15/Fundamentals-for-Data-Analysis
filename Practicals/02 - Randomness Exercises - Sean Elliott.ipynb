In this instance we are flipping a coin to determine the outcome of the above - there is a 50/50 chance that any coin flip will either land on heads or tails - with the previous outcome baring no consequence on the forthcoming result. This is because in a coin toss there can only be 2  possible outcomes (unless the coin lands on its edge, which has not been accounted for).\n",
